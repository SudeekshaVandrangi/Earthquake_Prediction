# Earthquake Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of earthquakes using historical seismic data. The models used include:

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Gradient Boosting Classifier

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these classifiers on earthquake prediction tasks and evaluate their accuracy.

# Project Outcomes
Implemented three different classifiers for earthquake prediction.

Achieved prediction accuracies using:

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Demonstrated basic preprocessing and model training on real earthquake data.

# Requirements
Python 3.6+
